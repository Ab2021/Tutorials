# Computer Vision Course Generation - Final Walkthrough

## Overview
We have successfully generated the complete 40-Day Computer Vision Course content, covering all phases from Foundations to Generative AI.

## Work Accomplished

### Phase 1: Foundations (Corrections)
*   **Day 5:** Updated to focus on Segmentation Basics (Thresholding, K-Means).
*   **Day 8:** Updated to focus on CNN Training (Optimization, Regularization).
*   **Day 9:** Updated to focus on Transfer Learning.

### Phase 2: Image Classification (Days 11-20)
*   **Classic Architectures:** AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, Inception, MobileNet.
*   **Modern Architectures:** ViT, Attention Mechanisms.
*   **Advanced Learning:** Self-Supervised, Few-Shot, Domain Adaptation.
*   **Project:** Fine-Grained Classification on CUB-200.

### Phase 3: Object Detection & Segmentation (Days 21-30)
*   **Detection:** R-CNN Family, YOLO, SSD, EfficientDet, DETR (Anchor-Free & Transformers).
*   **Segmentation:** FCN, U-Net, DeepLab, Mask R-CNN, Panoptic Segmentation.
*   **Project:** Pedestrian Detection & Tracking (DeepSORT).

### Phase 4: Generative Vision & 3D (Days 31-40)
*   **Generative Models:** Autoencoders (VAE), GANs (DCGAN, StyleGAN), Diffusion Models (DDPM, Stable Diffusion).
*   **3D Vision:** Point Clouds (PointNet), NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields).
*   **Video & Multimodal:** 3D CNNs, Video Transformers, CLIP, LLaVA.
*   **Capstone:** End-to-End Generative AI Application.

## File Structure
The course is organized as follows:
```
Computer_Vision_Course/
├── Phase1_Foundations/
├── Phase2_Classification/
├── Phase3_Detection/
└── Phase4_Generative/
    ├── Week7_GenerativeModels/ (Days 31-35)
    └── Week8_3DVision/ (Days 36-40)
```
Each day contains 3 files:
1.  `DayXX_Topic.md`: Core concepts and code.
2.  `DayXX_Topic_part1.md`: Deep dive into advanced details.
3.  `DayXX_Topic_interview.md`: 10 Interview questions and answers.

## Next Steps
The course content is ready for review and consumption. You can now proceed to:
1.  Review the content for any specific customizations.
2.  Start the course!
