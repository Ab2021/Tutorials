# Lab 01: Loading and Displaying Images

## Difficulty
🟢 Easy

## Problem Statement
Write a script to:
1. Load an image from disk using OpenCV.
2. Display the image in a window.
3. Print image dimensions (Height, Width, Channels).
4. Save the image in a different format (e.g., PNG to JPG).

## Starter Code
```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

def process_image(image_path):
    # TODO: Load image
    # TODO: Print shape
    # TODO: Display image
    pass
```
