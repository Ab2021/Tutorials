# Day 37: Observability & Tracing - Understanding System Behavior

## Summary
Comprehensive coverage of distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry, Jaeger), spans & traces for request flow visualization, context propagation across services, instrumentation (auto vs manual), sampling strategies, and production patterns for observability at scale.

**Key Topics**: OpenTelemetry SDK, Jaeger setup, trace/span creation, context propagation, auto-instrumentation, sampling (head-based, tail-based), performance impact mitigation, correlating logs/metrics/traces.

**File Statistics**: ~950 lines | Observability & Tracing mastered ✅
