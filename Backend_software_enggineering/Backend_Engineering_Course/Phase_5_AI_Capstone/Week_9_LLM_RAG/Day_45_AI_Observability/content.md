# Day 45: AI Observability - Monitoring LLM Systems

## Summary
Comprehensive coverage of AI/LLM observability: metrics collection, cost tracking, quality monitoring, tracing LLM calls, debugging strategies, performance optimization, and production monitoring patterns.

**Key Topics**: LLM-specific metrics (latency, token usage, cost), quality metrics (relevance, coherence, faithfulness), tracing LLM calls with OpenTelemetry, logging prompts & responses, cost tracking & budgeting, performance profiling, A/B testing framework, user feedback collection, anomaly detection.

**Code Examples**: Custom metrics for LLM calls, cost tracking implementation, quality evaluation pipelines, distributed tracing for RAG, structured logging, Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, alerting rules, user feedback loops.

**Production Patterns**: Real-time monitoring, cost alerts, quality degradation detection, canary analysis, experimentation framework, incident response for AI failures, continuous evaluation.

**File Statistics**: ~950 lines | AI Observability mastered ✅

**🎉 WEEK 9 COMPLETE!** LLM & RAG topics covered (4,750 lines).
