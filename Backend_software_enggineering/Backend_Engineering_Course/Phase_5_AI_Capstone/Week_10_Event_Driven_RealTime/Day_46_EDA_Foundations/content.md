# Day 46: Event-Driven Architecture Foundations

## Summary
Comprehensive coverage of event-driven architecture (EDA) fundamentals, patterns, benefits, challenges, and implementation strategies for building scalable, decoupled systems.

**Topics Covered**:
- Event-driven architecture principles
- Events vs messages vs commands
- Event types (domain events, integration events)
- Publisher-subscriber pattern
- Event bus/broker architecture
- Choreography vs orchestration
- Event catalog & schema registry
- Event versioning strategies
- Idempotency in event processing
- Error handling & retry patterns
- Dead letter queues

**Benefits of EDA**:
- Loose coupling between services
- Scalability & elasticity
- Asynchronous processing
- Real-time responsiveness
- Audit trail & event replay

**Challenges**:
- Eventual consistency
- Event ordering
- Debugging distributed flows
- Schema evolution

**Implementation Patterns**:
- Event notification
- Event-carried state transfer
- Event sourcing
- CQRS integration
