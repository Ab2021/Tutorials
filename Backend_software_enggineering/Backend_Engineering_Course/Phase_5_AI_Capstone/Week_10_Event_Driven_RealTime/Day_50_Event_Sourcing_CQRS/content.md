# Day 50: Event Sourcing & CQRS

## Summary
Advanced event-driven patterns covering Event Sourcing for storing state as events and CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) for separating read/write models.

**Topics Covered**:
- Event Sourcing fundamentals
- Event Store implementation
- Event versioning & upcasting
- Snapshots for performance
- Event replay & projection
- CQRS pattern principles
- Command & query separation
- Read models & projections
- Eventual consistency handling
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions
- Process managers vs sagas
- Event-driven microservices integration

**Code Examples**:
- Event sourcing with PostgreSQL/EventStoreDB
- Event store implementation
- CQRS architecture setup
- Command handlers
- Query handlers & read models
- Event projection building
- Saga orchestration
- Snapshot creation & restoration

**Production Patterns**:
- Event schema evolution
- Idempotency guarantees
- Conflict resolution
- Projection rebuilding
- Monitoring event streams
- Testing event-sourced systems

**Benefits & Trade-offs**:
- Complete audit trail
- Time travel debugging
- Event replay capability
- Complexity vs traditional CRUD
- Eventual consistency challenges
