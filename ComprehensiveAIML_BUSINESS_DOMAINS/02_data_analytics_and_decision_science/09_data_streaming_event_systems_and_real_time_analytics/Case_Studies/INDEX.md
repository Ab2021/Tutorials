# Module 09 Case Studies â€” Data Streaming, Event Systems and Real-Time Analytics

## Authoring standard

Every authored case must follow the [course authoring and numerical standards](../../../00_AUTHORING_AND_NUMERICAL_STANDARDS.md) and the linked case master: all 15 sections, bounded decision and baseline, traceable evidence, checked numerical walkthrough/sizing where applicable, failure diagnostics, 12–18 answered interview questions, and Section 15 last. This is a planned catalog, not completed cases; expand to all seven collection-index sections before publication. Evidence, implementation stage and editorial status remain separate.

## Planned cases

| # | Case | Required outcome | Status |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | Build fraud-alert streaming design | Design the decision, architecture, metrics, risks, and validation plan. | planned |
| 2 | debug consumer lag incident | Design the decision, architecture, metrics, risks, and validation plan. | planned |

## Suggested file naming

Use **01_case-slug.md**, then **02_case-slug.md**. Add **00_framework.md** only for shared constraints that every case needs.

## Reference-informed additions to develop

These are proposed writing briefs informed by interview examples. The examples are reference material only; no completed case, measured result or finished cheat sheet is implied. [Planning catalog, source limits and authoring gates](../../../00_REFERENCE_INFORMED_CASE_PLAN.md).

| Planning ID | Proposed case brief | Editorial relationship | Type | Decision / business question | Primary pattern | Secondary patterns | Evidence | Stage | Planning reviewed | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PLAN-2026-IR035 | Separate live rank approximation from exact competition settlement | Supporting curriculum; shared brief | hybrid | How should score events support fast display ranks and a reproducible final prize result? | `snapshot-consistency` | `idempotent-side-effects`, `correctness-contract` | not-measured | proposed | 2026-11-06 |  |

### Reference and transfer notes

| Planning ID | Example reference only | Scope boundary |
|---|---|---|
| PLAN-2026-IR035 | [REF-IR035](../../../../INTERVIEW_CASES/DSA/Sys_Des_DSA/Leaderboards/score_bucket_rank_consistency.md) | A sum of stale counters is not an exact settlement snapshot; tie semantics and late-event policy must be specified |

Case metadata, pattern definitions, supporting/contrasting references, structured backlog, review log and authoring checks for these additions are maintained in the linked central planning catalog. Existing planned rows elsewhere in this index retain their original status. A brief may be split or merged before canonical case IDs are assigned.
