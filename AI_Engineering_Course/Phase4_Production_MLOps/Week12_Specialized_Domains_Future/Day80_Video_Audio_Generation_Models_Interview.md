# Day 80: Video & Audio Generation Models
## Interview Questions & Production Challenges

### Interview Questions

#### Q1: What is the "Diffusion Transformer" (DiT) architecture?

**Answer:**
- It combines the **Diffusion** process (adding/removing noise) with the **Transformer** architecture (Attention).
- Previous diffusion models (Stable Diffusion) used U-Net (CNNs).
- **Benefit:** Transformers scale better, handle variable aspect ratios/durations via tokenization (patching), and capture long-range dependencies in time (video).

#### Q2: Why is Video Generation so much harder than Image Generation?

**Answer:**
- **Dimensionality:** Video is 3D (Time), Image is 2D. Compute scales cubically.
- **Consistency:** If a character turns their head, their face must remain the same. Flickering is a common artifact.
- **Physics:** The model must understand gravity, collision, and object permanence.

#### Q3: How does Audio Generation (Suno/Bark) work?

**Answer:**
- Often modeled as a **Sequence-to-Sequence** task.
- **Audio Codec (EnCodec):** Compresses raw audio into discrete tokens.
- **GPT:** Predicts the next audio token based on text prompt and history.
- **Decoder:** Converts tokens back to raw audio.

#### Q4: What is C2PA?

**Answer:**
- **Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity.**
- An open technical standard for cryptographically signing media.
- Allows verifying: "This image was created by Camera X" or "This video was generated by Sora".
- Essential for fighting deepfakes.

#### Q5: Explain "Latent Diffusion" for Video.

**Answer:**
- Instead of generating pixels directly (expensive), the model generates **Latent Vectors** (compressed representation).
- A **VAE Decoder** converts latents to pixels at the end.
- Reduces compute requirements significantly.

### Production Challenges

#### Challenge 1: Temporal Flickering

**Scenario:** The background of the video shifts and boils.
**Root Cause:** Independent generation of frames or lack of temporal attention.
**Solution:**
- **Temporal Attention Layers:** Layers that attend across the Time dimension.
- **Coherent Noise:** Using correlated noise across frames.

#### Challenge 2: Generation Speed

**Scenario:** Generating 5 seconds of video takes 5 minutes.
**Root Cause:** Massive compute.
**Solution:**
- **Distillation:** Consistency Models (LCM) reduce inference steps from 50 to 4.
- **Quantization:** FP8 inference.

#### Challenge 3: Control

**Scenario:** "Make the car turn left." Model makes it turn right.
**Root Cause:** Text prompts are imprecise controls.
**Solution:**
- **ControlNet:** Use a sketch or pose map to guide the generation.
- **Camera LoRAs:** Fine-tune on specific camera movements (Pan, Zoom).

#### Challenge 4: Audio-Visual Mismatch

**Scenario:** Explosion sound happens 1 second before the visual explosion.
**Root Cause:** Independent generation of audio and video.
**Solution:**
- **Joint Training:** Train on (Video, Audio) pairs.
- **Post-Processing:** Use AI to align timestamps.

#### Challenge 5: Deepfake Liability

**Scenario:** User generates a fake video of the CEO announcing bankruptcy.
**Root Cause:** Lack of safety filters.
**Solution:**
- **Prompt Filtering:** Block names of public figures.
- **Face Recognition:** Detect if generated face matches a banned list.
- **Watermarking:** Invisible watermarks (SynthID).

### System Design Scenario: AI Video Ad Generator

**Requirement:** Generate 15s ads for e-commerce products.
**Design:**
1.  **Input:** Product Image + Script.
2.  **Image-to-Video:** Animate the product image (SVD).
3.  **Avatar:** Generate a talking head (HeyGen) reading the script.
4.  **Audio:** Generate voiceover (ElevenLabs).
5.  **Compositing:** Combine Background Video + Avatar + Audio using ffmpeg.
6.  **Safety:** Check for prohibited content.

### Summary Checklist for Production
- [ ] **Architecture:** Use **DiT** based models.
- [ ] **Safety:** Implement **C2PA** and **Watermarking**.
- [ ] **Control:** Use **ControlNet** for precise direction.
- [ ] **Optimization:** Use **Distillation** for speed.
- [ ] **Sync:** Ensure **Lip Sync** accuracy.
