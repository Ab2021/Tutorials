# Day 81: Future of AI Engineering (AGI, Alignment, Regulation)
## Core Concepts & Theory

### The Road Ahead

**We are here:** L4 (Reasoning Agents).
**Next:** L5 (Agents that create Agents).
**Goal:** AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) - AI that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work.

### 1. Scaling Laws (The Bitter Lesson)

**Concept:**
- Performance scales predictably with Compute, Data, and Parameters.
- **Implication:** We haven't hit the wall yet. GPT-5, 6, 7 will be exponentially better.
- **Compute:** The new oil.

### 2. Alignment & Safety

**The Alignment Problem:**
- How to ensure superintelligence aligns with human values?
- **Outer Alignment:** Specifying the right goal.
- **Inner Alignment:** Ensuring the model actually pursues that goal (not a proxy).
- **Instrumental Convergence:** "Don't turn us into paperclips."

**Techniques:**
- **RLHF:** Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback.
- **Constitutional AI:** AI critiquing AI based on a constitution.
- **Interpretability:** Understanding *where* in the brain the model is lying.

### 3. Regulation (EU AI Act)

**Tiers:**
- **Unacceptable Risk:** Social scoring, biometric categorization (Banned).
- **High Risk:** Medical, Critical Infrastructure (Strict compliance).
- **General Purpose AI:** Transparency requirements.

### 4. Embodied AI (Robotics)

**Concept:**
- AI leaving the screen.
- **Foundation Models for Robotics:** RT-2, Figure 01.
- **Challenge:** Data scarcity (real world data is hard to get). Sim-to-Real transfer.

### 5. Neuromorphic Computing

**Concept:**
- Hardware that mimics the brain (Spiking Neural Networks).
- **Goal:** Energy efficiency. The brain uses 20W. GPUs use 700W.

### 6. The AI Engineer's Role

**Evolution:**
- **2022:** Prompt Engineer.
- **2023:** RAG Engineer.
- **2024:** Agent Engineer.
- **2025:** Cognitive Architect? (Designing mental states).

### 7. Post-Training (The New Moat)

**Concept:**
- Pre-training is commoditized.
- **Post-training** (RLHF, SFT, Reasoning Traces) is where the value is.
- **Synthetic Data:** Generating high-quality data to train the next generation.

### 8. Summary

**Future Strategy:**
1.  **Stay Adaptable:** Tools change every week. Principles remain.
2.  **Focus on Systems:** Building reliable systems from unreliable models.
3.  **Safety First:** Alignment is not optional.
4.  **Hardware:** Keep an eye on **LPUs** (Groq) and **Neuromorphic**.
5.  **Regulation:** Be aware of **EU AI Act**.

### Next Steps
In the Deep Dive, we will explore a Constitutional AI loop, an Interpretability visualization, and a Sim-to-Real concept.
