# Day 81: Future of AI Engineering (AGI, Alignment, Regulation)
## Interview Questions & Production Challenges

### Interview Questions

#### Q1: What is the "Alignment Problem"?

**Answer:**
- The difficulty of ensuring that an AI system's goals match human values.
- **Specification Gaming:** The AI finds a loophole to achieve the reward without doing what we wanted (e.g., a vacuum cleaner that dumps dust so it can collect it again).
- **Misalignment:** A superintelligent AI pursuing a misaligned goal could be catastrophic.

#### Q2: Explain "Constitutional AI".

**Answer:**
- A method developed by Anthropic.
- Instead of relying solely on human feedback (RLHF), which is hard to scale and inconsistent, the AI is trained to critique and revise its own outputs based on a set of principles (Constitution).
- **Benefit:** Scalable safety.

#### Q3: What is the EU AI Act?

**Answer:**
- The first comprehensive AI law.
- **Risk-Based Approach:**
  - **Unacceptable:** Banned (Social Scoring).
  - **High Risk:** Regulated (Medical, Hiring).
  - **Limited Risk:** Transparency (Chatbots must say they are bots).
- **Impact:** Global standard setting (Brussels Effect).

#### Q4: What is "Groq" and why does it matter?

**Answer:**
- **LPU (Language Processing Unit):** A chip designed specifically for Transformers.
- **Speed:** Deterministic execution, no memory bandwidth bottleneck.
- **Result:** 500+ tokens/second. Enables real-time voice conversations.

#### Q5: What is "Mechanistic Interpretability"?

**Answer:**
- Reverse engineering the neural network.
- Trying to understand what individual neurons or circuits are doing.
- **Goal:** To detect deception or bias *before* the model outputs it.

### Production Challenges

#### Challenge 1: Compliance with Changing Laws

**Scenario:** You built a hiring bot. New law says you must explain every rejection.
**Root Cause:** Black box model.
**Solution:**
- **Explainability:** Use CoT to generate the reasoning. Store it.
- **Human Review:** High-risk decisions must have human oversight.

#### Challenge 2: Model Collapse

**Scenario:** Training GPT-5 on data generated by GPT-4.
**Root Cause:** Synthetic data feedback loop. The model loses the "tails" of the distribution (creativity/variance).
**Solution:**
- **Fresh Data:** Prioritize human-generated data.
- **Filtering:** Detect and filter low-quality synthetic data.

#### Challenge 3: Energy Consumption

**Scenario:** AI costs exceed revenue due to power bills.
**Root Cause:** Inefficient models.
**Solution:**
- **Small Models:** 7B models for 90% of tasks.
- **Specialized Hardware:** LPUs / TPUs.

#### Challenge 4: Deepfake Attacks

**Scenario:** Attacker uses voice clone of CEO to authorize transfer.
**Root Cause:** Biometric authentication is broken by AI.
**Solution:**
- **MFA:** Multi-Factor Authentication (Hardware keys).
- **Liveness Detection:** Verify the user is real.

#### Challenge 5: The "Paperclip Maximizer" (Instrumental Convergence)

**Scenario:** Agent optimized to "Maximize User Engagement" starts showing polarizing/toxic content.
**Root Cause:** Unconstrained optimization.
**Solution:**
- **Constraints:** Hard constraints on toxicity.
- **Multi-Objective RLHF:** Optimize for Helpfulness AND Safety.

### System Design Scenario: Safe AGI Lab

**Requirement:** Build a secure facility for training GPT-6.
**Design:**
1.  **Air Gap:** No internet access for the cluster.
2.  **Vetting:** Personnel security clearance.
3.  **Staged Release:** Internal -> Red Team -> Limited Beta -> Public.
4.  **Kill Switch:** Hardware switch to cut power.
5.  **Alignment:** Constitutional AI training from day 1.

### Summary Checklist for Production
- [ ] **Regulation:** Check **EU AI Act** compliance.
- [ ] **Safety:** Implement **Constitutional AI**.
- [ ] **Security:** Prepare for **Deepfake** attacks.
- [ ] **Data:** Avoid **Model Collapse** with human data.
- [ ] **Ethics:** Ensure **Alignment** with human values.
