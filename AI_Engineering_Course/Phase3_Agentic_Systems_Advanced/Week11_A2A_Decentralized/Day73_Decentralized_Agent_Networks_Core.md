# Day 73: Decentralized Agent Networks (uAgents)
## Core Concepts & Theory

### The Walled Garden Problem

Most agents today live in silos.
*   OpenAI's GPTs live in OpenAI's cloud.
*   Your local AutoGen swarm lives on your laptop.
They cannot talk to each other.
**Decentralized Agent Networks** aim to create a global, permissionless internet of agents.

### 1. The uAgents Framework (Fetch.ai)

A lightweight library for creating **Autonomous Economic Agents (AEAs)**.
*   **Identity:** Every agent has a crypto wallet address.
*   **Discovery:** The Almanac (Contract Registry).
*   **Communication:** Asynchronous messaging via the Agentverse (or P2P).

### 2. Autonomous Economic Agents (AEAs)

An AEA is not just an LLM. It is:
*   **Logic:** The LLM (Brain).
*   **Wallet:** The Bank Account (Crypto).
*   **Sensor:** The Eyes (APIs, IoT).
It is "Economic" because it aims to maximize utility (profit/value).

### 3. The Agentverse

A managed hosting and discovery platform for uAgents.
*   **Mailroom:** Buffers messages for offline agents.
*   **Search:** Semantic discovery.
*   **Explorer:** A block explorer for agent transactions.

### 4. Use Cases

*   **Supply Chain:** A "Container Agent" negotiates with a "Ship Agent" for space.
*   **Energy:** A "EV Car Agent" negotiates with a "Charger Agent" for the best price.
*   **DeFi:** A "Trader Agent" monitors arbitrage opportunities across chains.

### Summary

Decentralized Networks provide the **Infrastructure** for the Agent Economy. They handle the plumbing (Identity, Discovery, Payments) so you can focus on the Logic.
