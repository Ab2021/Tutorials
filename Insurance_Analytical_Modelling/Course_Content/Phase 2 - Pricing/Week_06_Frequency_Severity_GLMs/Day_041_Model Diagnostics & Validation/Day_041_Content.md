# ### Day 41 – Model Diagnostics & Validation

*   **Topic:** Is the Model Good?
*   **Content:**
    *   **Residuals:** Deviance residuals, Pearson residuals.
    *   **Tests:** AIC/BIC (Penalizing complexity), Gini Index (Lorenz curve for lift).
    *   **Consistency:** One-way plots (Actual vs. Expected by variable).
*   **Interview Pointers:**
    *   "Explain the Lift Chart." (How much better does the model segment risk compared to random/current rating?).
*   **Challenges:** Overfitting to noise in small segments.
