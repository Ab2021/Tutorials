# ### Days 48–49 – Stochastic Reserving: Mack & Bootstrap (CAS MAS-II)

*   **Topic:** Quantifying Reserve Uncertainty
*   **Content:**
    *   **Mack's Model:** Analytic variance of Chain Ladder.
    *   **Bootstrapping:** Resampling residuals to generate a distribution of reserves.
    *   **Output:** Reserve ranges (e.g., 75th percentile).
*   **Interview Pointers:**
    *   "Why is a point estimate for reserves insufficient?" (Management needs to know the range of outcomes for capital planning).
*   **Challenges:** Heteroscedasticity in residuals.
