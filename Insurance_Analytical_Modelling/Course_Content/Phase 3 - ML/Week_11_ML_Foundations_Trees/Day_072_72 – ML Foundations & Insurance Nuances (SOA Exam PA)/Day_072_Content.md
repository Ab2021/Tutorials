*   **Topic:** The ML Workflow
*   **Content:**
    *   **Supervised vs. Unsupervised:** Labels (Fraud/No Fraud) vs. Patterns (Segmentation).
    *   **Splitting:** Train/Test vs. Time-based splitting (Crucial for insurance).
    *   **Metrics:** RMSE/MAE (Regression), AUC/LogLoss (Classification), Gini/Lift (Ranking).
*   **Interview Pointers:**
    *   "Why is random splitting bad for claims data?" (Data leakage – claims from the same policy/event might end up in both sets).
