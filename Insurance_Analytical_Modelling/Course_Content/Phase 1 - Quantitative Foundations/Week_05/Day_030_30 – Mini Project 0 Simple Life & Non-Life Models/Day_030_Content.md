# ### Days 28–30 – Mini Project 0: Simple Life & Non-Life Models

*   **Topic:** Practical Implementation (Excel/Python)
*   **Project 1 (Life):** Build a term life pricing model in Excel.
    *   Inputs: Mortality table, interest rate, expense loading.
    *   Output: Level premium.
*   **Project 2 (Non-Life):** Fit a Gamma distribution to a severity dataset in Python (`scipy.stats`).
    *   Calculate Mean, VaR(99%).
*   **Deliverable:** A short report explaining the premium derived and the tail risk estimated.
*   **Interview Hook:** "I built a ground-up pricing model using CSO tables and demonstrated sensitivity to interest rate changes."
