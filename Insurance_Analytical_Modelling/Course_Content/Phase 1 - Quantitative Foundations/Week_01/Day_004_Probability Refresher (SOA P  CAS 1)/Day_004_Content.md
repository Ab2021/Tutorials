*   **Topic:** Probability Theory for Insurance
*   **Content:**
    *   Random variables (Discrete vs. Continuous).
    *   Expectation (Mean), Variance, Skewness, Kurtosis (Fat tails are key!).
    *   Conditional Probability & Bayes' Theorem (Updating beliefs with new info).
    *   Moment Generating Functions (MGFs).
*   **Interview Pointers:**
    *   "Explain the difference between independent and mutually exclusive events."
    *   "Calculate the expected value of a policy with a deductible."
*   **Tricky Parts:** Conditional expectation $E[X|X>d]$ (Expected payment given a claim exceeds deductible).
