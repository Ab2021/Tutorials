# ### Days 76–78 – Neural Nets & Interpretable Deep Pricing

*   **Topic:** Deep Learning in Actuarial Science
*   **Content:**
    *   **Embeddings:** Handling high-cardinality categoricals (Zip Code, Vehicle Model).
    *   **Combined Models:** Multi-output networks (Frequency & Severity heads).
    *   **Interpretability:** CANN (Combined Actuarial Neural Networks) – GLM skip connection + NN residual.
*   **Interview Pointers:**
    *   "Why are Neural Networks hard to get approved by regulators?" (Black box nature).
*   **Data Requirements:** Large datasets (>100k rows).
