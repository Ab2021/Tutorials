## How to Use This Course

1.  **Start with Phase 1:** Ensure your mathematical foundations are solid. Even if you are a Data Scientist, understanding "Actuarial Notation" is crucial for credibility.
2.  **Projects:** Each phase includes mini-projects. Do not skip them. They are your portfolio.
3.  **Interview Prep:** Each day includes specific "Interview Pointers". Practice answering these out loud.
4.  **Data:** We have specified data requirements for each section. Use public datasets (e.g., Kaggle Prudential Life, Allstate Claims) or simulate data where necessary.

## Global Threads

Throughout the course, keep these themes in mind:
*   **Regulation:** How does this model comply with state laws?
*   **Data Quality:** Garbage in, garbage out.
*   **Explainability:** Can you explain this to a non-technical underwriter?
*   **Business Impact:** How does this improve the Combined Ratio?
