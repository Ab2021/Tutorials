## 1. Equity Deep Dive

### 1.1 RSUs vs Options
*   **RSU**: Actual shares. Value = Price. Safe.
*   **Options**: Right to buy at Strike Price. Value = Price - Strike. High risk/reward.
*   **Tax**: RSU taxed as income at vest. Options taxed at exercise (AMT risk).

### 1.2 Refreshers
*   Initial grant vests over 4 years.
*   **Refresher**: New grant given annually to "top up".
*   **Cliff**: Watch out for the "4-year cliff" where comp drops if refreshers don't stack up.

## 2. Leverage Strategy

### 2.1 Competing Offers
*   "I have an offer from X for $Y."
*   **Best Leverage**: Offer from a competitor (Google vs Meta).
*   **Timing**: Line up interviews so offers land same week.

## 3. Tricky Interview Questions

### Q1: "What is your current salary?"
> **Answer**:
> *   **Don't tell**. In many states, it's illegal to ask.
> *   **Say**: "I'm focusing on the role and the market value for this level. I'm expecting competitive compensation."

### Q2: "What is your expected number?"
> **Answer**:
> *   **Don't give a number first**.
> *   **Say**: "I'm open. Can you share the band for this role?"

### Q3: "We can't match base, but we can give more equity."
> **Answer**:
> *   Paper money.
> *   Accept only if you believe in the company (Pre-IPO).
> *   For public companies, RSU is liquid, so it's fine.

## 4. Practical Edge Case: Exploding Offers
*   **Tactic**: "This offer expires in 24 hours."
*   **Counter**: "I need time to discuss with family. I can give you an answer by Friday." (Most recruiters will extend. They spent months finding you).
