## 1. The Offer Stage

You passed the interviews. Now what?

### 1.1 Team Matching
*   **Ask**: "What is the on-call load?" "What is the balance between research and product work?"
*   **Red Flag**: "We have data, we just need you to find a use case." (Means they have no infrastructure).

### 1.2 Negotiation
*   **Leverage**: Competing offers are the only leverage.
*   **Equity**: Understand RSUs, Vesting Schedule (4-year cliff?), and Refreshers.
