## 1. STAR+ (The Senior Add-on)

Standard STAR is Situation, Task, Action, Result.
**STAR+** adds **Reflection**.

### 1.1 The Reflection
*   "If I were to do it again, I would..."
*   "The biggest lesson I learned was..."
*   **Why?**: Shows growth mindset and maturity. Junior engineers just execute. Senior engineers learn.

## 2. The "Conflict" Question

"Tell me about a time you disagreed with a coworker."

### 2.1 The Trap
*   Don't say: "He was wrong, I proved him wrong." (Arrogant).
*   Don't say: "We agreed to disagree." (Passive).

### 2.2 The Senior Answer
*   **Focus**: Data vs Opinion.
*   "We had different assumptions. I proposed we run a small A/B test / POC to gather data. The data showed X. We moved forward with X together."
*   **Key**: Disagree and Commit.

## 3. Tricky Interview Questions

### Q1: "What is your greatest weakness?"
> **Answer**:
> *   **Bad**: "I work too hard." (Humble brag).
> *   **Good**: Real weakness + Mitigation.
> *   "I tend to get lost in the details of code optimization. I've started using time-boxing (Pomodoro) and asking for early design reviews to keep me focused on the big picture."

### Q2: "Tell me about a time you failed."
> **Answer**:
> *   Pick a real failure.
> *   Focus on the **Post-Mortem**.
> *   "I deployed a model that caused a latency spike. I rolled back immediately. We implemented a Canary deployment stage to prevent this from happening again."

### Q3: "How do you manage up?"
> **Answer**:
> *   "I ensure my manager has visibility into risks early. I provide options with trade-offs (Fast vs Cheap vs Good), not just problems."

## 4. Practical Edge Case: The Silent Interviewer
*   **Scenario**: Interviewer doesn't nod or smile.
*   **Fix**: Don't panic. Stop and ask: "Does this level of detail make sense, or should I pivot to the high-level architecture?"
