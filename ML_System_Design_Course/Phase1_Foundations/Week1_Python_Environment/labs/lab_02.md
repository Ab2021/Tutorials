# Lab 02: NumPy Broadcasting

## Difficulty
🟡 Medium

## Problem Statement
Given a dataset of `N` points in `D` dimensions (shape `N x D`) and a set of `M` centroids (shape `M x D`), compute the Euclidean distance from every point to every centroid using NumPy broadcasting (no loops!).

## Starter Code
```python
import numpy as np

def compute_distances(points, centroids):
    """
    Args:
        points: (N, D) array
        centroids: (M, D) array
    Returns:
        (N, M) array of distances
    """
    # TODO: Implement using broadcasting
    pass
```
