## Module 5: Real-World Applications and Advanced Scenarios

### Lesson 5.2: Case Study 2: The AI-Powered Trip Planner (10:30 - 12:00)

---

### **1. Objective: The Power of Composition**

This case study represents the ultimate vision of the Model Context Protocol: **a vibrant ecosystem of specialized, interoperable servers that can be composed by a client to create powerful and sophisticated AI agents.** We will move beyond the single-server model and explore how a Host application can connect to multiple, independent MCP servers simultaneously to orchestrate a complex, multi-step workflow.

**Our Goal:** To design an AI assistant that can help a user plan a travel itinerary and then deploy that itinerary as a public webpage. This task requires a combination of capabilities that are unlikely to exist in a single monolithic server: location-based data retrieval and webpage deployment.

**The Multi-Server Architecture:**

The Host application (our AI Trip Planner) will act as the central orchestrator, connecting to two separate, specialized MCP servers:

1.  **Amap Maps MCP Server:** A hypothetical server that provides tools for interacting with a mapping service like Amap (or Google Maps). It will have a tool for finding points of interest.
2.  **EdgeOne Pages Deploy MCP Server:** A hypothetical server that provides a tool for deploying static HTML content to a cloud hosting service like Tencent Cloud EdgeOne.

**Key Learning Outcomes:**

*   **Compositional AI:** Understanding how to build complex agents by combining the capabilities of multiple, single-purpose servers.
*   **The Role of the Client as Orchestrator:** Seeing how the client is responsible for managing connections to multiple servers and weaving their capabilities together.
*   **The Ecosystem Vision:** Appreciating how the MCP standard enables a marketplace of reusable, interoperable AI-accessible tools.
*   **End-to-End Agentic Workflow:** Tracing a complete workflow from a high-level user request to a final, tangible outcome (a deployed webpage).

### **2. The Cast of Characters: The Host and the Servers**

Let's define the capabilities of our Host application and the two servers it will connect to.

#### **The Host: The AI Trip Planner**

*   **Function:** A chat-based interface where a user can interact with an AI assistant to plan a trip.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Manage the user interface (the chat window).
    *   Maintain the overall state of the trip plan.
    *   Connect to and manage the lifecycle of both the Amap and EdgeOne MCP servers.
    *   Send prompts to the LLM, including the tool definitions from *both* servers.
    *   Orchestrate the workflow by calling tools on the appropriate servers based on the LLM's recommendations.

#### **Server 1: The Amap Maps MCP Server**

*   **Purpose:** Provides location-based data and search.
*   **Key Capability:** A single tool, `amap/text_search`.
*   **Tool Definition (`amap/text_search`):**
    *   **Description:** "Searches for points of interest (like restaurants, attractions, hotels) in a given city."
    *   **Input Schema:**
        ```json
        {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "city": {"type": "string", "description": "The city to search in, e.g., 'Shenzhen'."},
            "query": {"type": "string", "description": "The type of place to search for, e.g., 'restaurants', 'museums'."}
          },
          "required": ["city", "query"]
        }
        ```
    *   **Output Schema:** Returns a list of locations, each with a name, address, and rating.

#### **Server 2: The EdgeOne Pages Deploy MCP Server**

*   **Purpose:** Provides a simple way to deploy static web content.
*   **Key Capability:** A single tool, `edgeone/deploy`.
*   **Tool Definition (`edgeone/deploy`):**
    *   **Description:** "Deploys a given string of HTML content to a new, publicly accessible URL on EdgeOne Pages."
    *   **Input Schema:**
        ```json
        {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "html_content": {"type": "string", "description": "The full HTML content of the webpage to be deployed."},
            "site_name": {"type": "string", "description": "A unique name for the deployment, e.g., 'shenzhen-trip-plan'."}
          },
          "required": ["html_content", "site_name"]
        }
        ```
    *   **Output Schema:** Returns the public URL of the deployed webpage.

### **3. The Workflow: From a Simple Prompt to a Deployed Webpage**

Now, let's trace the entire workflow step-by-step. This demonstrates the intricate dance between the user, the client, the LLM, and the two independent servers.

**(ASCII Art Diagram of the Multi-Server Workflow)**

```
+------+   +------------------+   +--------------------+   +-----------------------+   +-----------------------+
| User |-->|  AI Trip Planner |-->|        LLM         |-->|  Amap Maps MCP Server |   | EdgeOne Deploy Server |
+------+   | (Host / Client)  |   +--------------------+   +-----------------------+   +-----------------------+
           +------------------+

1. User: "Plan a one-day trip in Shenzhen."

2. Client sends prompt to LLM with tool schemas from *both* servers.

3. LLM reasons: "To plan a trip, I need attractions and restaurants."
   LLM responds with a `tool_call` for `amap/text_search` (query: "tourist attractions").

4. Client receives `tool_call`, gets user approval, and sends request to Amap Server.

5. Amap Server returns a list of attractions.

6. Client sends the attractions list back to the LLM and asks for the next step.

7. LLM reasons: "Now I need restaurants."
   LLM responds with another `tool_call` for `amap/text_search` (query: "restaurants").

8. Client calls Amap Server again and gets a list of restaurants.

9. Client sends the restaurant list to the LLM and asks it to synthesize an itinerary.

10. LLM generates a complete HTML document for the itinerary.

11. Client displays the plan to the user: "Here is the itinerary. Shall I deploy it?"

12. User: "Looks good, deploy it."

13. Client sends the generated HTML to the LLM with the `edgeone/deploy` tool schema.

14. LLM responds with a `tool_call` for `edgeone/deploy` with the HTML content.

15. Client receives `tool_call`, gets user approval, and sends request to EdgeOne Server.

16. EdgeOne Server deploys the page and returns the public URL.

17. Client displays the final URL to the user: "Here is the public link: ..."

```

### **4. A Deeper Dive into the Key Steps**

Let's analyze some of the critical moments in this workflow.

#### **Step 2: The Composite Prompt**

This is the most important part of the client's job as an orchestrator. When it sends the initial request to the LLM, it must provide a complete picture of all available capabilities. The prompt sent to the LLM would look something like this:

```
You are a helpful trip planning assistant. The user wants you to plan a trip.
Based on the user's request, decide which of the following tools to call.

--- AVAILABLE TOOLS ---

Tool #1:
Name: amap/text_search
Description: Searches for points of interest (like restaurants, attractions, hotels) in a given city.
Schema: {"properties": {"city": ..., "query": ...}}

Tool #2:
Name: edgeone/deploy
Description: Deploys a given string of HTML content to a new, publicly accessible URL.
Schema: {"properties": {"html_content": ..., "site_name": ...}}

--- USER REQUEST ---

Plan a one-day trip in Shenzhen.
```

By providing the full list of tools, the client empowers the LLM to act as a true reasoning engine. The LLM can see that it has the ability to both *find information* and *take action* and can formulate a plan that uses both.

#### **Steps 6 & 9: The Iterative Conversation**

The client doesn't just fire and forget. It engages in an iterative conversation with the LLM. After each tool call, it gets the result and goes back to the LLM with the new information, asking, "What's next?" This loop continues until the LLM has gathered all the information it needs to satisfy the user's original request.

This is a fundamental pattern for building agentic systems. The agent (the client + LLM) progressively builds up a context by using its tools, getting closer to the final goal with each step.

#### **Step 15: The Handoff Between Servers**

This is where the magic of composition happens. The output of a process that used the **Amap Maps Server** (the generated HTML itinerary) becomes the input for a tool call on the completely separate **EdgeOne Deploy Server**. 

The client is the essential intermediary that makes this handoff possible. The two servers are completely unaware of each other. They are single-purpose, reusable components. The client, guided by the LLM, is the one that connects them, creating a workflow that is more powerful than the sum of its parts.

### **5. Conclusion: The MCP Ecosystem**

This trip planner case study, while hypothetical, is a powerful illustration of the future that MCP enables. It's a future where:

*   **Developers focus on building specialized, high-quality tools.** A mapping company can provide a brilliant `Amap Maps MCP Server` without having to worry about how it will be used.
*   **Application developers can rapidly build complex AI agents** by composing these off-the-shelf tools, rather than building everything from scratch.
*   **Users get access to incredibly powerful, multi-functional assistants** that can seamlessly integrate information and actions from a wide variety of sources.

MCP provides the common language and the secure protocol to make this ecosystem a reality. It is the foundational layer for moving beyond simple, single-purpose AI helpers to truly capable, compositional AI agents.
