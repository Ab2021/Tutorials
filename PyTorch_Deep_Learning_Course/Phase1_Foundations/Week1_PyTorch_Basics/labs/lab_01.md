# Lab 01: Tensor Operations

## Difficulty
🟢 Easy

## Problem Statement
Perform the following operations using PyTorch tensors:
1. Create a random tensor of shape (3, 4, 5).
2. Reshape it to (3, 20).
3. Permute dimensions to (4, 3, 5).
4. Perform matrix multiplication with a compatible tensor.

## Starter Code
```python
import torch

def tensor_ops():
    x = torch.randn(3, 4, 5)
    # TODO: Implement operations
    pass
```
