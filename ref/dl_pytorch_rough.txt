update accordingly following last instructions.Think deeply when creating the day by day .md report.Add anything if i have missed out.Your task is to add notes answers ,questions anything that is relevant from beginner to advanced level  continue with day 1 ; explain in very detailed theoretical way.For creating the .md file  plan and divide the day based files into slno with topics and their subtopics like day02_001_compression_storage.md for easy understanding of the topics and manitianing token limitation. Strictly ENFORCE THIS when dividing content into files.Focus more creating theoretical texts , rather than just putting code        │
│   snippets; divide files   
But if you feel the file contents are getting lengthy feel free to divide it into multiple parts; just keep the theory very comprehensive.
IMP-Always adhere with the daily topics given in the course and donot deviate
