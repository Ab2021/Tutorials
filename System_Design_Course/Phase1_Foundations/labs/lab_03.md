# Lab 03: LRU Cache Implementation

## Difficulty
🔴 Hard

## Problem Statement
Design and implement a Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache.
It should support:
- `get(key)`: Get value, move to front (most recently used).
- `put(key, value)`: Insert value. If capacity reached, remove least recently used.

Time Complexity: O(1) for both operations.

## Starter Code
```python
class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self, capacity: int):
        # TODO: Initialize structures (Hash Map + Doubly Linked List)
        pass

    def get(self, key: int) -> int:
        pass

    def put(self, key: int, value: int) -> None:
        pass
```
