## 💡 Implementation Strategy
*(A guide on how to approach today's tasks)*

- **Step 1**: Review the theoretical concepts outlined in the topics section.
- **Step 2**: Analyze the provided code examples (if any) to understand the syntax and logic.
- **Step 3**: Set up the hardware environment, ensuring all connections are correct.
- **Step 4**: Implement the basic driver/module step-by-step.
- **Step 5**: Run the lab exercises in sequence, verifying each step.
- **Step 6**: Debug any issues using the techniques learned in previous sessions.
- **Step 7**: Optimize the code for performance and memory usage.

## 🐞 Common Pitfalls
*(Watch out for these common mistakes)*

- **Hardware**: Incorrect wiring, power supply issues, loose connections.
- **Software**: Memory leaks, race conditions, incorrect register configuration, stack overflow.
- **Protocol**: Timing violations, wrong baud rate/clock polarity, missing pull-up resistors.
- **Logic**: Off-by-one errors, infinite loops, unhandled exceptions.
