## 📌 Program Overview
This curriculum is designed as a **full-stack embedded engineering development roadmap** used in advanced automotive, robotics, and camera-based embedded systems. It includes a **progressive path** from bare‑metal programming → operating systems → Linux kernel → camera frameworks → SerDes → ISP tuning → synchronization → automotive system integration.

The structure maintains:
- **Day-by-day progression**
- **Guided labs** for every learning unit (beginner → advanced)
- **Industry alignment** with automotive expectations (ISO 26262, Functional Safety, EVS)
- **Cross‑platform mindset:** Linux, QNX, GHS Integrity, Android Automotive (EVS HAL)

---

## 🎯 Competency Framework
Upon completion, a learner will be able to:
- Build bare‑metal firmware (MCU/RTOS)
- Configure, customize and debug the Linux kernel
- Write platform and V4L2 camera drivers
- Bring up CSI‑2 and SerDes-based camera pipelines
- Tune ISP pipelines (RAW → YUV → metadata)
- Implement multi-camera synchronization and low-latency streaming
- Operate within automotive software compliance frameworks
