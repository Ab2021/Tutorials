# Lab 05: Dutch National Flag Problem

## Difficulty
🟡 Medium

## Estimated Time
45 mins

## Problem Statement
Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

## Starter Code
```python
def sort_colors(nums):
    """
    Sorts the array nums in-place.
    """
    # TODO: Implement one-pass algorithm
    pass
```
