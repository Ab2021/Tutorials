## Problem 1: Basic Complexity Analysis Review Application

**Question**: [Problem statement]

```python
# Example:
# Input: [sample input]
# Output: [expected output]
```

**Solution**:
```python
def solve_problem_1(input_data):
    # Implementation
    result = []
    # Process data
    return result

# Time: O(?), Space: O(?)
```

**Explanation**:
- Step 1: [Explanation]
- Step 2: [Explanation]
- Step 3: [Explanation]

## Problem 2: Intermediate Challenge

**Question**: [Problem statement]

**Solution Approach 1: Brute Force**
```python
def brute_force(data):
    # O(n²) or similar
    pass
```

**Solution Approach 2: Optimized**
```python
def optimized(data):
    # O(n) or better
    pass
```

**Comparison**:
| Approach | Time | Space | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| Brute Force | O(?) | O(?) | Simple but slow |
| Optimized | O(?) | O(?) | Better performance |

## Problem 4: System Design Integration

**Question**: Design a system component using Complexity Analysis Review

**Answer Framework**:
1. **Requirements**: Clarify functional and non-functional requirements
2. **Data Structure Choice**: Why Complexity Analysis Review is appropriate
3. **API Design**: Interface definition
4. **Complexity Analysis**: Time and space tradeoffs
5. **Scalability**: How it handles growth

**Implementation Sketch**:
```python
class SystemComponent:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize data structures
        pass
    
    def operation1(self, params):
        # Core functionality
        pass
    
    def operation2(self, params):
        # Additional functionality
        pass
```
