## 📚 Course Overview

This comprehensive DSA course takes you from foundational concepts to interview mastery in **75 days**. Unlike typical algorithm courses, this curriculum emphasizes:

- ✅ **Deep Theoretical Understanding** - Why algorithms work, not just how
- ✅ **Modern Implementations** - Latest optimizations and industry practices (2025)
- ✅ **Interview Excellence** - Company-specific patterns and problem-solving frameworks
- ✅ **Practical Applications** - Real-world use cases and system design integration

---

## 🎯 Quick Start

1. **Read the Syllabus**: Start with [`dsa_learning_course.md`](dsa_learning_course.md)
2. **Begin Day 1**: Navigate to [`Phase1_Foundations/Week1_Complexity_Arrays/Day1_Complexity_Analysis.md`](Phase1_Foundations/Week1_Complexity_Arrays/Day1_Complexity_Analysis.md)
3. **Follow the Structure**: Each day has 3 files (Core, Deep Dive, Interview)
4. **Practice Daily**: Spend 2-3 hours per day for optimal results
