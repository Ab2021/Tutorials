*   **Curiosity-Driven Learning:** Intrinsic rewards for exploration.
*   **Empowerment:** Learn skills that give the agent control over the future.

## 2. Causal Reinforcement Learning
Understand **cause-and-effect** relationships:
*   **Causal Models:** Model interventions and counterfactuals.
*   **Off-Policy Evaluation:** Estimate policy performance from logs using causal inference.
*   **Transfer Learning:** Use causal structure for better generalization.

## 3. Continual Learning in RL
Learn multiple tasks sequentially without forgetting:
*   **Challenge:** Catastrophic forgetting when learning new tasks.
*   **Solutions:**
    *   Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC).
    *   Progressive Neural Networks.
    *   PackNet (partition network parameters per task).

## 4. Graph Neural Networks for RL
Use GNNs to model relational structure:
*   **Multi-Agent RL:** Model agent interactions as graphs.
*   **Combinatorial Optimization:** Route planning, scheduling.
*   **Molecular Design:** RL for drug discovery with graph-structured molecules.
